StegVerse SCW (Lite) — Public Site + Cross-Repo Toolkit
=======================================================

This lite package contains everything you need on iPhone/Codespaces to:
- Publish the public site to an external repo (e.g., StegVerse/site) via GitHub Pages
- Verify Pages
- Round-trip sync between external site repo and this toolkit
- Avoid the 'zip opens in editor' issues with a tiny footprint

Start here (in Codespaces terminal):
  scripts/util/doctor.sh
  scripts/site/one_prompt_public_site.sh

If you need the full SCW (ops + CI + status + governance) later, say the word and we’ll ship that bundle again.
