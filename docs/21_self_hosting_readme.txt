Self-Hosting Roadmap (Sovereign)
================================
- Control-plane hardening (branch protection, CODEOWNERS, DCO, signed commits).
- Data & secrets sovereignty (KeePass/Vault, no plaintext in Git).
- Storage & artifacts (MinIO/Harbor), GitOps (ArgoCD/Flux), K3s/Nomad.
- Mirror/migrate from GitHub to Gitea/Forgejo when ready.
